            <h1>Actively curious about business, tech, politics, economics and Data Science.</h1>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>I am Juan Esteban Serna Vega. I was born in Medellin (Colombia) in the 90s.

                During my childhood I lived with my mother’s family in a country town in west Antioquia. The main economic activity for the family was a coffee farm; while my mother and a couple of her sisters worked as teachers at elementary and high schools in the town.
                
                I love music since I was a kid. Back then I used to play triumph. I was also part of a marching band (percussion). However, my dreams disappeared soon due to an expansion in our daily school hours.
                
                During my adolescence I stayed with my father’s family. I went to the university in Medellin. Years later, I started as intern at a global steel producer. I worked there for almost seven years.
                
                Working for someone else is an experience I usually recommend since it allows to develop collaboration for you’re usually part of a team. In addition, it might help you structure your thoughts, give you some knowledge, expertise and the opportunity of learning from other people’s experiences.</p>
            
            <h2>Special memories</h2>
                
            <p>One special moment for me was in 2017. After some weeks in the Young Professionals program, sharing with more than 60 trainees from all the countries the company had presence on, the members of that cohort granted me the award of Global Business Vision.</p>
